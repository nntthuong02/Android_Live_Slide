# Live Slider - Parallax Slideshow Live Wallpaper

Welcome to Live Slider! This open-source Android application transforms your home screen into a dynamic, interactive experience. It creates a captivating parallax effect based on your device's movements and allows you to set up a personalized slideshow of your favorite wallpapers. Built with modern Android development practices, Live Slider is designed to be both feature-rich and developer-friendly.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Dynamic Parallax Effect:** Creates an illusion of depth by shifting the wallpaper in response to the device's rotation, providing an immersive 3D-like experience.
- **Customizable Slideshows:** Automatically cycle through your selected images at intervals you define, from seconds to hours.
- **Playlist Management:** Organize your wallpapers into distinct playlists for different moods or themes.
- **Double-Tap to Change:** A quick double-tap on your home screen instantly switches to the next wallpaper in your slideshow.
- **Material You & Dynamic Theming:** The app's UI seamlessly integrates with your device's color palette and system theme (Android 12+).
- **Fine-Grained Customization:** Adjust the parallax sensitivity, slideshow frequency, and other settings to perfectly match your preferences.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio (latest stable version recommended)
- An Android device or emulator with **Rotation Vector Sensor** support. The parallax effect will not work without this sensor.

### Installation & Build
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/droid2developers/LiveSlider.git
    ```
2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    - Launch Android Studio.
    - Select `File > Open` and navigate to the cloned project directory.
3.  **Sync Gradle:**
    - Let Android Studio sync the project and download the required dependencies.
4.  **Build and Run:**
    - Select the `app` configuration and a target device.
    - Click the "Run" button. The app will be installed on your device.
5.  **Set as Live Wallpaper:**
    - Open the app and configure your desired settings.
    - Activate the live wallpaper through the app's main screen.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Architecture & Technical Details

<summary><strong>Click to expand: Core Concept & How It Works</strong></summary>

### The Core Concept
The fundamental idea behind Live Slider is to create a more engaging and dynamic home screen. The parallax effect is achieved by using the device's orientation sensors to subtly shift the wallpaper. This creates a sense of depth, making it feel like you are looking through a window into a 3D space. Combined with the slideshow feature, the wallpaper becomes a constantly refreshing and personalized element of the user interface.

### How the Parallax Effect is Implemented
1.  **Sensor Data Acquisition:** The `RotationSensor` class registers a listener for the `TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR` sensor. This sensor provides accurate data about the device's orientation in 3D space.
2.  **Offset Calculation:** The raw sensor data (a quaternion) is processed to determine the device's pitch and roll. These values are then mapped to X and Y offsets. A smoothing filter is applied to prevent jittery movements.
3.  **OpenGL Rendering:** The `LiveWallpaperRenderer` uses OpenGL ES to render the wallpaper. It applies the calculated X and Y offsets to the texture coordinates of the wallpaper image. This shifts the texture on the rendering surface, creating the parallax motion.
4.  **User Control:** The user can adjust the "Parallax Strength" in the settings. This value acts as a multiplier for the calculated offsets, allowing the user to control the intensity of the effect.

- **GLWallpaperService:** A crucial base class that simplifies the creation of OpenGL-based live wallpapers. It manages the `EGL` context and rendering surface, allowing us to focus on the rendering logic itself.
- **Android Architecture Components:**
    - **ViewModel:** Manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way, surviving configuration changes.
    - **LiveData:** An observable data holder that respects the lifecycle of UI components.
    - **Room:** A persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite for robust local data storage. Used for storing wallpaper lists and playlists.
    - **WorkManager:** Manages deferrable, asynchronous background tasks, perfect for scheduling the wallpaper slideshow.
- **Material Components for Android:** Provides modern, customizable UI components that implement the Material Design system, including support for Material You.
- **EventBus:** A publish/subscribe event bus that simplifies communication between components (e.g., from the background service to the UI) without requiring direct dependencies.
- **Glide:** An efficient image loading and caching library that handles loading wallpapers from URIs, resizing, and applying transformations.
- **Kotlin Coroutines:** Used for managing asynchronous operations and background tasks in a structured and concise way, especially within ViewModels and repositories.
